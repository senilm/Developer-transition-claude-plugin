description: Generates a personalized learning plan for a developer based on their Phase 1 assessment results. Reads the strength/weakness report and codebase profile to create a prioritized study plan with specific resources and project file references. Use when creating a study plan, onboarding guide, or learning roadmap after assessment evaluation.

# Learning Plan Generator

Creates a targeted learning plan based on the candidate's Phase 1 assessment results. Prioritizes weak areas and maps them to specific learning actions.

## Prerequisites

- `transition/phase1-report.md` must exist (generated by assessment-evaluator)
- `transition/codebase-profile.md` must exist (for referencing project tech)

If either file is missing, tell the user what's needed.

## Workflow

1. **Read the inputs**: Load the Phase 1 report and codebase profile.

2. **Extract weak areas**: From the report, pull out:
   - Topics marked as Weak (highest priority)
   - Topics marked as Moderate (secondary priority)
   - Patterns section (tells us if the issue is depth, breadth, or practical experience)

3. **Build learning modules**: For each weak/moderate topic, create a learning module with:
   - **Topic name**: What to study
   - **Current level**: What the assessment showed (from the report)
   - **Target level**: What they need to reach to work on this project
   - **Learning objectives**: 3-5 specific things they should understand after studying
   - **Recommended resources**: Official docs, tutorials, articles (use well-known, stable resources — no random blog posts)
   - **Project references**: Specific files or folders in THIS project they should read once they have the foundational knowledge (use Grep and Glob to find relevant files)
   - **Practice exercise**: One small hands-on task they can do to verify their understanding

4. **Prioritize and sequence**: Order the modules logically:
   - Foundational topics first (if they don't know Lambda basics, don't start with advanced SAM)
   - Group related topics together
   - Estimate time needed per module (light review: 1-2 hours, moderate study: 3-5 hours, deep learning: 1-2 days)

5. **Add a study timeline**: Based on the total estimated time, suggest a realistic timeline with milestones. Include a checkpoint at the halfway mark where the candidate can self-assess.

6. **Save**: Write the plan to `transition/learning-plan.md`

7. **Verify**: Re-read the plan. Ensure:
   - Every weak topic from the report has a module
   - No module references technologies not in this project
   - Resources are real and well-known (no made-up URLs)
   - Project file references actually exist in the codebase
